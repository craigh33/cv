Currently, a Software Engineer at N-able who is able to adapt and is keen to learn new technologies. I can demonstrate working knowledge in many aspects of modern software development such as Agentic AI, CI/CD, Object-Oriented programming, Cloud Architecture, and automation. Possessing good team working skills in varied work environments, my current goal is to grow as a software engineer, sharpening my skill set to push myself towards more senior roles.
