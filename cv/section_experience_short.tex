    {Present}   {Software Engineer}{N-able}{United Kingdom}
    {Oct 2022} {
                      Throughout my time at N-able, I was a member of multiple teams spanning multiple projects, from N-able's Cloud management offering to its latest Agentic AI offering. This position has boosted my skills and gave me many opportunities to grow as an engineer, working with modern technology stacks and technology. I progressed from Software Engineer I to Software Engineer II in my time at N-able, giving me the experience required to push for more senior roles.
                      \begin{itemize}
                        \item Development of Agentic AI - Given my time in N-able's first Agentic AI product, I participated in the development of agents compliant with A2A, to help our customers manage their devices. Through this project I was involved in developing not only the agents and our multi-agent architecture, but our agent tooling via MCP servers, and was given the opportunity to expand this knowledge with a trip to AWS re:Invent, where I learned about how the industry is progressing to an Agentic AI future.
                        \item Cloud Development – During my time at N-able, I was also involved in the CC Platform Team, who were involved in Architecting, and Developing the core components of the new product. With this, I was exposed to AWS and Azure technologies and best practices.
                        \item Team Focus – As a mid-level engineer, I am expected to help the more junior members of the team grow their skills, and impart my knowledge via documentation and pair programming.
                      \end{itemize}

    {Oct 2022} {Software Engineer}{NCR Corporation, XFS Integration Test Team}{United Kingdom}
    {Aug 2019}    {
                      The XFS IT Team in Dundee is a small team tasked with testing components of NCR's XFS ATM Software product and the support of hardware test with software utilities. The XFS product is shipped with every NCR ATM in the world and is responsible for the hardware drivers and APIs to control them. Being a member of this team involves working independently on different tasks and projects whilst coordinating with different development teams and stakeholders.
                      \begin{itemize}
                        \item QA Process Experience – Assisted in the testing of software components to be included in the NCR XFS Software stack ensuring that critical bugs weren't missed before delivering to customers.
                        \item Independent Worker - Designed and developed an automated robotic hardware test application. This consisted of an application on the ATM alongside a Universal Robots collaborative robot. This solution helped ease the lack of manual testing during Covid lockdown periods and ensured that transaction targets could still be met.
                        \item Experience with CI/CD - Designed and implemented a process to migrate SVN projects to GitHub. This involved creating a CI/CD pipeline where none had previously existed. This has led to quality improvements of both tools and scripts.
                      \end{itemize}
                    }

    {Aug 2018}     {Summer Intern}{Blue2 Digital}{United Kingdom}
    {June 2018}    {
                      During my internship, I conducted R\&D in the field of headless Content Management Systems. This mainly involved migrating data from current Blue2 websites to several well-known headless CMS's to discover how difficult it may be to migrate and how doing so could help with the company's workflow.
                      \begin{itemize}
                        \item Experience in Web Development – I used a wide range of technologies relevant to the current market including HTML, CSS, JavaScript and hugely increased my knowledge in PHP.
                        \item Can Present Work in Front of an Audience - At the end of my placement I had to present my findings to the stakeholders and then the company.
                      \end{itemize}
